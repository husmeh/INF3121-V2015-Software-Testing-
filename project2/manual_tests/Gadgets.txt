Comment:		
			Manual tests not done:
				* "After rolling back an edit, automatically open the contributions of the user whose edit has been rolled back"
					Will skip as we are not prepared to roll-back/undo Wikipedia contributions of other users.
				* In my opinion not important to normal user:
					- ImageAnnotator, to view notes and comments that people have placed upon images shown on file description pages.
					- Redirect image links to Commons for files that are hosted there
					- Print options gives you more control when printing content. Remove images or the background for instance.
					- The revisionjumper creates an interface which allows you to jump between different revisions.
					- Suppress display of fundraiser banners
					- Suppress display of all Central Notices
					- "Ask a question" feature for the Teahouse project
					- Reference Tooltips: Roll over any inline citation to see reference information, instead of having to jump away from the article text.
					- FormWizard. A wizard for creating and expanding project pages.
					- Geonotice: Display notices on your watchlist about events in your region.
					- Do not show green bullets for pages that have changed since your last visit, and hide the reset button.
					- Add two new dropdown boxes below the edit summary box with some useful default summaries
					- Citation expander: Automatically expand and format citations (uses "Citation bot").
					- Syntax highlighter, make syntax stand out colorfully in the edit box. Works best in Firefox and works almost all of the time in Chrome and Opera.
					- HotCat, easily add / remove / change a category on a page, with name suggestion [example]
					- wikEdDiff, improved diff view between article versions (not needed if wikEd is used)
					- ProveIt, a powerful GUI tool for viewing, editing, adding, and inserting references (screenshot, working demo)
					- wikEd, a full-featured integrated text editor for Firefox, Safari, and Google Chrome. Please read the help page for usage instructions.
					- Yet Another AFC Helper Script: easily review Articles for creation submissions, Files for Upload, redirect and category requests
					- Form for filing disputes at the dispute resolution noticeboard
					- refToolbar, adds a "cite" button to the editing toolbar for quick and easy addition of commonly used citation templates.
				    - Add an [edit] link for the lead section of a page
				    - Add a clock in the personal toolbar that displays the current time in UTC (which also provides a link to purge the current page).

				    - Add a selector to the Wikipedia search page allowing the use of external search engines.
				    - Allow navigation menus to be collapsed.

				    - Change the "new section" tab text to instead display the much narrower "+".

				    - Display a floating alert when I have new talk page messages
				    - Justify Paragraphs.
				    - Move section [edit] links to the right side of the screen.
				    - PrettyLog gives the lists on Special:Log the same layout as on the Special:Search result pages. If the log shown contains file uploads, add small thumbnails (Documentation on Commons).
				    - Show radio buttons to switch between views of certain content, such as some maps
				    - SidebarTranslate, changes the language links in the sidebar so their text is displayed in English
				    - Vector classic typography (use only sans-serif in Vector skin)
				    - Widen the search box in the Vector skin.
				    - Mark navigation links to featured (Monobook-bullet-star.png) and good (Monobook-bullet-ga.png) articles in other languages.
					- DejaVu Sans, a font with support for various dingbats. This gadget works on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox 3.5, and Safari. Install this gadget if you need better font and character support but cannot install fonts directly onto your computer.
