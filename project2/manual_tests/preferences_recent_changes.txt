Expected result:	Step (1)-(3): Error message.
			Step (4)-(6): Message that settings has been saved.
			Step (8)-(10): Give some error message, as everything except positive integers should be invalid input.
			Step (11)-(12): Give some error message, as everything except positive integers should be invalid input.

Actual result:		Step (1)-(3): Error message: "There are problems with some of your input."
			Step (4)-(6): Message that settings has been saved.
			Step (8)-(10): Error: "Input a number." This error depends on Javascript, if not active in browser then invalid input is undetected. 
			Step (11)-(12): "Your preferences have been saved." -10 is interpreted as 0 (you can see that if you go to "Recent changes"). Probably a bug.

			Step (13)-(16): PASS
			Step (17)-(19): PASS
			Step (20)-(22): PASS

			Step (29)-(31): PASS

Comment:		Step (17)-(19): If you list too few edits you are not garantueed to find such a triangle even if the setting has been saved.
			Step (20)-(22): If you list too few edits you are not garantueed to find such a "m" even if the setting has been saved.
			Step (23)-(25): No verification: This tester did not find any edit line with a "D", even with 1000 entries in the edit list. If you list too few edits you are not garantueed to find such a "D" even if the setting has been saved.
			Step (26)-(31): I found this somewhat protected page (Iceland) by coincidence. Stable release pages are time-dependent. It will probably not be later in time. 

			I could not figure out how to test the following radioboxes:
 				- Use the default settings for each page
