Expected result:	Step (8)-(10): Give some error message, as everything except positive integers should be invalid input.
			Step (11)-(12): Give some error message, as everything except positive integers should be invalid input
Actual result:		Step (8)-(10): "Your preferences have been saved." fifteen is interpreted as 0. Probably a bug.
			Step (11)-(12): "Your preferences have been saved." -10 is interpreted as 0 (you can see that if you go to "Recent changes"). Probably a bug.
Pass/Fail:		
Comment:		Step (12): If you list too few edits you are not garantueed to find such a triangle even if the setting has been saved.
			Step (15): If you list too few edits you are not garantueed to find such a "m" even if the setting has been saved.
			Step (18): No verification: This tester did not find any edit line with a "D", even with 1000 entries in the edit list. If you list too few edits you are not garantueed to find such a "D" even if the setting has been saved.
			I could not figure out how to test the following radioboxes:
				- Use detailed boxes to show review status of pages
 				- Use small icons and minimal text to show review status of pages	
 				- Use the default settings for each page
			Step (19)-(24): I found this somewhat protected page by coincidence. Stable release pages are time-dependent. It will probably not be later in time.
