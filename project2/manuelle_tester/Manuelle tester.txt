Comment:		All good. We can se that it’s possible to test for the positive and negative testing since we get error message when we
			try to put an invalid value in fields 2) - 7) it appears that only positive digits of specified value are legal. Otherwise
			it would be possible to enter any value that wouldn’t give sense for the user. Popups when entering invalid value e.g letters
			or other characters dont give error but a popup that says only digits possible.

Comment:		Step (17)-(19): If you list too few edits you are not garantueed to find such a triangle even if the setting has been saved.
			Step (20)-(22): If you list too few edits you are not garantueed to find such a "m" even if the setting has been saved.
			Step (23)-(25): No verification: This tester did not find any edit line with a "D", even with 1000 entries in the edit list. If you list too few edits you are not garantueed to find such a "D" even if the setting has been saved.
			Step (26)-(31): I found this somewhat protected page (Iceland) by coincidence. Stable release pages are time-dependent. It will probably not be later in time.

Comment:		We can se that it’s possible to test for the positive and negative testing since we get error message when we
			try to put an invalid value in fields 2) - 7) it appears that only positive digits of specified value are legal. Otherwise
			it would be possible to enter any value that wouldn’t give sense for the user. The reason of choosing “Hide my edits from the watchlist” in 			advanced options is because we can make Selenium IDE to go in to the HTML and CSS source file and specifie what to look for because the user 
			username is not a variable that changes like the variables in Watchlist options with that changes with time and are not possible to automate
			Changes are variables that change and some times it can say “Below are the last 37 changes in the last 720 hours” another day it may say
			Below are the last 60 changes in the last 720 hours. SO it’s difficult to test a variable.
