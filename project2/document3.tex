\title{Assignment 2: Manual tests that could not be automated}

\section{CreateAccount}
The value of \texttt{id=wpName2} is \textit{husven\_test3}, but since we already created this user in the manual test, this username is not unique. One could of course 
change this value to something unique, but the automated test would still fail because the value of \texttt{id=wpCatchaWord} is \textit{aryanbusy} which is probably not 
the answer to the captcha given.

One could probably make an automated test that copied the source of the captcha image, made use of an online decaptcha service, copied the captcha word 
and pasted it into \texttt{id=wpCaptchaWord}, but we did not find such a service available freely.
